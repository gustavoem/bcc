Basic Syntax
- Functions start with gl
- Constants are define GL_LIKE_THIS
- Types are defined GLLikeThis


Related Libraries
- OpenGL Utilities (GLU) provides more complex functions. All GLU functions starts with
glu.
- Open Inventor is a library in C++ with OO that has some functions for 3d drawing
- OpenGL does not create windows. To create a window. To create windows you can use
    - GLX for X Window Systems
    - AGL for Apple
    - WGL for Microsoft
    - PGL for IBM(?)
    - GLUT for any window system =)


Header Files
If we were using Windows without glut:
- windows.h
- GL/gl.h
- GL/glu.h
Instead of this, we include only the GLUT library. 
- GL/glut.h     <- The location of the GLUT library can vary depending on the system.
                   For Apple this would be GLUT/glut.h
Also, GLUT ensures that gl.h and glu.h are included (we can include but it would be
redundant).


Display-Window Management unsing GLUT
Initializing
- glutInit (&argc, argv);
Creating the window
- glutCreateWindow ("Window Title");
Setting callback for drawing
- glutDisplayFunc (funcname);
"Activating" windows: this is what sets glut to look for user interactions in a loop.
- glutMainLoop ();


Other functions
glutInitWindowPosition (x, y)
glutInitWindowSize (x, y)
The coordinates here are v > and the origin is the upper left corner


OpenGL functions
glClearColor (r, g, b, a) - sets the color for cleaning (GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)
glClear () - clears screen with the color
glColor3f (r, g, b) - sets a color


GLU Functions
glOrtho2D (xi, xf, yi, yf) - sets the coordinates of our drawing. The origin is the 
bottom left and the axis are ^ >


Error Handling
OpenGL records one error at time. Once an error occours, no other error will be recorded
until you get the present error.
    GLenum code;
    code = glGetError ();
We can also get a string description for each error:
    code = glGetError ();
    string = gluErrorString (code);
    fprintf( stderr, "OpenGL error: %s\n", string);
