\lettersection{About Me}
\par I'm a computer science student from University of S達o Paulo, in Brazil. In the year of 2014 I was selected to participate in the program Science Without Borders, provided by Government of Brazil, and in  August 2015 I moved to College Station, Texas, to study at Texas A\&M University for two semesters.
\par I started my computer science program in University of S達o Paulo in February 2013 and I have already completed 60\% of my course credits (not couting credits from Texas A\&M) which makes December 2017 my expected graduation date.

\lettersection{Background}
\par My first working experience  was being professor assistant of Introduction to Computer Science class, in University of S達o Paulo. In this opportunity I worked grading students homeworks, answered students questions and also had the opportunity to replace the professor for two of the first lectures. This opportunity led me to my second working experience when the professor I assisted offered me a position as an undergraduate researcher.
\par In my research I worked for Butantan Institute and S達o Paulo Research Foundation researching about the U-Curve problem, an optimization problem that is defined over a boolean lattice and where the objective function describe u-shaped curves for every chain of the lattice. In this opportunity I had to work in a big framework for solving U-Curve problems adding a new algorithm as an attemptive to solve the problem more efficiently. While working on this project I had to read papers and existing code; elaborate new code and solutions; and finally compare results from new algorithms with the ones that already exists.

\lettersection{Objectives for the Summer}
\par My main objective for the summer is to learn, from tools and techniques to theories. Since I started college I always wanted to do research and my first experience doing research was really great for me; I could learn a lot coding in a big, already existent, framework and also studying different subjects in computer science mainly related to optimization. I enjoy learning and I also see that this is really good for my career. 
\par Another goal of mine for the summer is to meet more people from my area. Since I arrived in the United States I met people from a lot of different places and this was great for me to learn from them about different cultures and also to make my contact network wider, which, I believe, can give more opportunities in the future. If I stay in the U.S. for this summer I will be able to meet even more people and make my contact network even wider.
