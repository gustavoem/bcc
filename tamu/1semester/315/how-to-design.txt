Writing for a Peer Developer
- The goal of a peer developer design document is to make sure that your ideas are valid an that approach works with what others are doing. 
Sections of the document:
- Section 1: State the purpose of your project/sub-system
- Section 2: Define the high level entities in your design
- Section 3: For each entity, define low level design.
    - Usage: why do you need the object and what it does
    - Configuration: if your object needs any special initialization
    - Model: kinda of uml
    - Interaction: another kind of uml (flux diagram)
-Section 4: Benefits, assumptions, risks/issues
