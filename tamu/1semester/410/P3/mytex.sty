% \begin{definitions} ... \end{definitions} --- definitions environment

%     This is the neat definitions environment by Brian T Schellenberger 
%     <bts@sas> from the texhax news.group.  It lets you do "programming" 
%     in LaTeX like in most programming languages:  Space is only for the 
%     convenience of the programmer.  In other words, you can space things 
%     so that they look pretty in LaTeX source code and you no longer need 
%     tons of ugly percent signs at the ends of lines.  
%     Below is Brian's original documentation.  --EPM

%%   definitions: within \begin{definitions} (which does not really define
%%   a group), spacing means nothing.  Use \space for a space character
%%   and \par for a blank line, for those rare instances where they are
%%   really desired.  Also, @ is seen as a letter.  All these are reversed
%%   with \end{definitions} --- even if they had the same catagories before!
%%   These should not be nested but, unfortunately, there is no way to tell.

  \def \@currenvir {definitions}    % [ see remark below ]

% [ Remark: Originally, the last two lines above (\begingroup... & \def...)
%   were the other way round.  However, all of a sudden, TeX chocked whenever
%   parsing ``\end{definitions},'' so I had to change it as above.  It seems
%   a bit more logic now, but then, I don't really know...  (The \@currenvir 
%   tells LaTeX that it was parsing \begin{definitions}...\end{definitions}.

% - The following two are for using postscript figure.
% - Must first use \documentstyle[12pt,epsf]{article}
% - The first one psmp is to put one figure centered on a page.
% - format is: psmp{your_ps_file.ps}{0.6}{0.2}
% - where the file name is oobvious and the 0.6 is the size of the figure.
% - and 0.2 is the portion of page down the right column (above will center
% - the figure) \psmp{zz.ps}{0.6}{0.4} would flush-left the figure.
%
% - The second one (pspair is to put two PS files side by side with
% - comments.
% - usage: pspair{left_ps.ps}{Left label}{right_ps.ps}{Right label}
