{Tech Lead}
{Geekie}
{São Paulo, Brazil}
{May 2022 - Present}
{
    Worked on two of the main Geekie products: Geekie One, a data-driven 
    platform for basic education; and Geekie Teste, a test platform that 
    uses IRT to provide students abilities scores that are comparable 
    with ENEM (Brazilian High School National Exam) scores.
    \newline
    - Led teams of 4-5 developers, assisting their technical development
    and also creating a high-performance environment (resulting in the
    promotion of one team member to Software Engineer II);
    \newline
    - Worked on updating legacy systems to Python 3, focusing on Geekie 
    Teste, and also created pipelines to run tests automatically;
    \newline
    - Designed and implemented an async solution that enabled school
    Coordinators to send student grading reports to parents;
    \newline
    - Collaborated on implementing GraphQL in our application, 
    which became the first option for most squads when fetching data;
    \newline
    - Worked on a refactor of Geekie Teste that allowed more than 20K
    simultaneous students answering tests.

{}
{January 2020 - May 2022}
{
    Worked as a full-stack engineer in squads of 4-6 people.
    \newline
    - Worked on the front-end, using React and React-Native, and also on
    the back-end, using Python and Flask;
    \newline
    - Designed and implemented a solution that allowed creating reports
    that aggregated the performance of many students, with different
    granularity;
    \newline
    - Worked on the refactor of a core feature, allowing schools to
    offer courses to students of different grade levels.
\newline\textbf{Skills:}  Redis Queue, Heroku, AWS ECS, AWS EC2, AWS
    Lambda, Flask, React, React-Native, Python, BigQuery, MongoDB,
    PostgreSQL, ORM/ODM.

    and advisor). We created a Python program 
    (github.com/gustavoem/SigNetMS) that allowed Cell Signaling Model
