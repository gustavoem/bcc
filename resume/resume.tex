{Software Engineer}
{Geekie}
{São Paulo, Brazil}
{January 2020 - Present}
{Worked as a full stack engineer in squads of 4 to 6 people. I worked on
the development of new features for the Geekie One app, including tasks 
of the back-end, in Python, and tasks of the front-end, where we used 
code-sharing with React and React-Native. Some of the technologies and
services I had contact with were: AWS EC2 and Lambda; Heroku; New Relic;
and Sentry.
Some of the features I worked on are: student homework; 
homework grading; and school reports.
%After one year of experiences, I started working closer to the squad
%technical leadership, taking some responsibilities of this role.
%I promoted technical development of pairs, and worked closer to the 
%Product Manager, helping our squad determine the next steps, and 
%designing solutions.

{\color{awesome}\underline {Masters project}} in a team of 2 (student 
    and advisor). This project consisted in finding models based on
    system of ordinary differential equations for cell signaling
    networks. To rank models, we implemented a Bayesian method to
    estimate the marginal likelihood of a model. As a result, we created
    a Python software, called SigNetMS, that creates estimatives of
    the marginal likelihood of a model (github.com/gustavoem/SigNetMS).
